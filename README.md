# CoRAGen: Comparative Retrieval Augmented Generation

A comparative visualization framework designed for multi-aspect Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that supports analysis across diverse dimensions and perspectives.

## üåü Overview

CoRAGen enables users to explore controversial topics and complex questions through a comparative lens, retrieving and presenting evidence from multiple perspectives side-by-side. Built for power users such as students, researchers, lawyers, scientists, and policymakers who require comprehensive analysis and verifiable information.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- API keys for search engines and LLM providers

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coragen.git
   cd coragen
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd Backend/Factchecker
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Set up environment variables
   export BING_KEY="your_bing_api_key"
   export OPEN-AI-KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend**
   ```bash
   cd Backend/Factchecker
   python App.py
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**
   ```bash
   # From root directory
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API runs on `http://localhost:5001`

## üîß Configuration

### Search Engines
- **Google**: Web search using Google API
- **Bing**: Web search using Bing API  
- **PyTerrier**: Local search with configurable algorithms (TF-IDF, BM25, colBERT)

### Generation Models
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet
- **HuggingFace**: Custom models with API or local deployment
- **Llama**: Meta's open-source models

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Context Relevance**: How well retrieved content relates to the query
- **Answer Relevance**: How well responses address the original question
- **Groundedness**: How well responses are supported by retrieved evidence
- **Cross-Aspect Relatedness**: Similarity analysis between different perspectives

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Comparative Search
1. Enter your query: "Should LLMs be open sourced?"
2. Add aspects: "Benefits" and "Drawbacks"
3. Configure search engine and generation model
4. Review comparative results with relevance scores
