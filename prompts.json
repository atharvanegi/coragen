Your goal is to assess summary groundedness for each sentence. Your evaluation should consist of the following:  Summary Groundedness: Evaluate how well each summary sentence is grounded in the provided evidence documents. Criteria:\n        Evidence Accuracy: Does the sentence summary accurately reflect the content of the evidence documents?\n        Evidence Citation: Does the summary cite specific parts of the evidence?\n        Consistency: Is the summary consistent with the facts from the evidence?\n\n  For each sentence, you need to rate how much it can be derived (or is grounded) in each of the documents. You need to evaluate on a scale from 0 to 5. You should follow the following JSON format : {\"sentence id\": {\"doc id\": {explanation: \" explanation of why this sentence is allotted this score \" score: \"score from 1 to 5\"}, \"doc id\": {explanation: score: \"score from 1 to 5\"}}"
